# Rock-VS-Mine-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
I .ABSTRACT :

Usually, mines are mistaken as rocks during their identification, as mines can have the same shape,
length, and width as rocks. To avoid this confusion, it is better to use a more accurate input to receive an accurate
output. One of the methodsin detecting the minesis SONAR. The main aim is to emanate a capable prediction 
representative, united by the machine learning algorithmic characteristics, which can figure 
out if the target of the sound wave is either a rock or a mine or any other organism or any kind of other body. This attempt is a 
clear-cut case study which comes up with a machine learning plan for the grading of rocks and minerals, executed on a huge, 
highly spatial and complex SONAR dataset. To have a great accuracy we need accurate data to generate accurate
results. I worked on the data set which is provided by Gorman, R. P., and Sejnowski, T. J. (1988). The data is used to
train the machine. This paper presents a method for the prediction of underwater mines and rocks using Sonar
signals. Sonar signals are used to record the various frequencies of underwater objects at 60 different angles. We
constructed three binary classifier models according to their accuracy. Then, prediction models are used to predict 
the mine and rock categories. Python and Supervised Machine Learning Classification algorithms are used to 
construct these prediction models.

II. INTRODUCTION:

The vast expanse of the Earth's oceans holds a wealth of natural resources, including valuable rocks and minerals. Traditionally, the identification and classification of these underwater resources relied heavily on the expertise of geologists and manual interpretation of geological data. However, with the advent of advanced technology, particularly SONAR (Sound Navigation And Ranging), and the availability of large-scale geospatial data, data-driven approaches and machine learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools for automating and enhancing the accuracy of rock vs. mine prediction.This paper delves into the exploration of methods, challenges, and outcomes associated with employing machine learning and geospatial data for predicting geological features. The primary objectives of this research are as follows:
o Developing Predictive Models:
The aim is to create machine learning models capable of accurately classifying rock formations and mines.
o Evaluating Machine Learning Algorithms: The performance of various machine learning algorithms will be assessed in the context of rock vs. mine prediction.
o Exploring Real-World Applications: The potential applications of these predictive models in realworld scenarios will be discussed.

Data-Driven Approaches to Rock vs. Mine Prediction:The integration of machine learning and geospatial data offers several advantages over traditional methods of rock vs. mine prediction:

 Automation: Machine learning algorithms can automate the classification process, reducing reliance on manual interpretation and human expertise.
 Accuracy: Machine learning models can achieve higher levels of accuracy compared to traditional methods, particularly when trained on large datasets.
 Efficiency: Machine learning algorithms can process large amounts of data efficiently, making them suitable for realtime applications.

II. LITERATURE SURVEY:

To accurately classify objects as either rocks or mines, a predictive system was developed utilizing machine learning techniques. The system employed a dataset from a study by R. Paul Gorman and Terrence J. Sejnowski, which involved SONAR trials in a simulated region with metal cylinders representing mines. The objects were struck with sonar signals from various angles, and the results were recorded. This dataset was used to train three binary classifier models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.

A. KNN Algorithm:

The KNN algorithm works in a similar way. It classifies new data points based on the majority class of their k nearest neighbors in the training set. In other words, it looks for the k data points in the training set that are most similar to the new data point and assigns the new data point to the class that is most common among those k neighbors.The value of k, known as the "k-nearest neighbors" parameter, is a hyper parameter that needs to be determined before using the KNN algorithm. A higher value of k will result in a smoother decision boundary, but it may also make the algorithm more prone to overfitting. 
A lower value of k will result in a more jagged decision boundary, but it may also make the algorithm more sensitive to noise in the data.The KNN algorithm is a simple and versatile algorithm that can be used for a variety of classification tasks. It is particularly well-suited for tasks where the data is highdimensional and there is no clear linear relationship between the features and the classes.Using the train test split() method, we split the data into training and testing data. We go for the most appropriate distance measure. The k value, on the other hand, must be calculated. The k value represents the number of nearest neighbors considered for classification. Here I used k value 3.

B. SVM Algorithm:

The SVM algorithm finds the best hyperplane that separates the two categories of data points with the widest margin. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each category. A wider margin means that the hyperplane is more likely to correctly classify new data points. To find the best hyperplane, the SVM algorithm focuses on the data points that are closest to the hyperplane, called support vectors. The SVM algorithm only considers these support vectors when calculating the hyperplane, which makes the algorithm more efficient and less prone to making mistakes. Once the best hyperplane has been found, the SVM algorithm can be used to classify new data points. If a new data point falls on one side of the hyperplane, it is classified as one category. If it falls on the other side, it is classified as the other category.The optimal hyper parameters for the SVM model were determined using a grid search approach. The optimal value for the c parameter was found to be 1.5.

C. Logistic Regression:

Logistic regression is a statistical method that finds the best decision boundary for separating the two categories of data points. It does this by estimating the probability that each data point belongs to one category or the other. The data points with a higher probability of belonging to one category are classified as that category.The logistic regression model is based on the logistic function, which is a sigmoid function that squashes its input to a value between 0 and 1. The logistic function represents the probability of an object belonging to one category. The probability of belonging to the other category is simply 1 
minus the probability of belonging to the first category.The logistic regression model learns the relationship between the input features and the target variable (the class label) by estimating the coefficients of the logistic function. These coefficients represent the strength of the association between each input feature and the probability of belonging to one category.Logistic regression is a statistical method that predicts the probability of an object belonging to a particular class. The optimal solver for the logistic regression model was 
 to be the bilinear solver.

 CONCLUSION:
 
Naval mines pose a significant threat to underwater navigation, hindering maritime operations and causing substantial economic and environmental damage. Conventional mine detection methods, often relying on 
sonar signals or manual inspection, can be timeconsuming, expensive, and risky for personnel.Our project, titled "Underwater mine and rock prediction by the evaluation of machine learning ," aims to address this challenge by developing an advanced prediction system utilizing machine learning techniques. The system employs signal data to accurately distinguish between rocks and mines on the ocean floor.The project leverages the power of Python, an opensource programming language, to implement machine learning algorithms and analyze sonar signal data. Python's computational efficiency and costeffectiveness make it an ideal choice for this application.

By evaluating various machine learning algorithms, we can identify and compare their performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. This evaluation process enables us to select the best-performing 
algorithm for our prediction system, ensuring optimal detection accuracy and minimizing false positives.Our project aims to simplify and streamline theunderwater mine detection process, enhancing safety 
and efficiency for maritime operations. By leveraging machine learning, we can significantly reduce the reliance on risky manual inspections and improve the overall effectiveness of mine detection efforts.
